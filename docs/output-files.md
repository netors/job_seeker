ORDER BY match_score DESC
LIMIT 10;

-- Salary analysis
SELECT
    AVG(CAST(SUBSTR(salary_range, 1, INSTR(salary_range, '-')-1) AS INTEGER)) as avg_min_salary,

WHERE location IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY location
HAVING job_count > 2
ORDER BY avg_match DESC;

-- Success rate analysis
SELECT
    CASE
        WHEN match_score >= 90 THEN 'Excellent (90+)'
        WHEN match_score >= 80 THEN 'Good (80-89)'
        WHEN match_score >= 70 THEN 'Fair (70-79)'
        ELSE 'Poor (<70)'
    END as match_category,
    COUNT(*) as total_applications,
    SUM(CASE WHEN outcome = 'offer' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as offers_received,
    ROUND(100.0 * SUM(CASE WHEN outcome = 'offer' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) / COUNT(*), 2) as success_rate
FROM job_opportunities
WHERE application_status != 'not_applied'
GROUP BY match_category
ORDER BY avg_match_score DESC;
```

#### Database Tools and Integration

**SQLite Browser Access:**
```bash
# Install SQLite browser (one-time setup)
# macOS: brew install --cask db-browser-for-sqlite
# Windows: Download from https://sqlitebrowser.org/

# Open database
open job_opportunities.db
```

**Python Integration:**
```python
import sqlite3
import pandas as pd

# Connect to database
conn = sqlite3.connect('job_opportunities.db')

# Load data into pandas for analysis
df = pd.read_sql_query("""
    SELECT title, company, match_score, salary_range, location
    FROM job_opportunities
    WHERE match_score > 75
    ORDER BY match_score DESC
""", conn)

# Perform analysis
print(df.describe())
print(df.groupby('company')['match_score'].mean().sort_values(ascending=False))

conn.close()
```

**Data Export:**
```sql
-- Export to CSV
.mode csv
.output high_match_opportunities.csv
SELECT title, company, location, match_score, url
FROM job_opportunities
WHERE match_score > 85
ORDER BY match_score DESC;
.output stdout
```

## File Management Best Practices

### Organization Strategy

**Directory Structure:**
```
job_search_results/
├── 2024-12-01/
│   ├── job_search_report.md
│   ├── application_strategy.md
│   └── job_opportunities.db
├── 2024-12-08/
│   ├── job_search_report.md
│   ├── application_strategy.md
│   └── job_opportunities.db
└── analysis/
    ├── trends_analysis.sql
    ├── success_metrics.py
    └── market_research.md
```

**Backup Strategy:**
```bash
# Weekly backup script
#!/bin/bash
DATE=$(date +%Y-%m-%d)
mkdir -p backups/$DATE
cp job_search_report.md backups/$DATE/
cp application_strategy.md backups/$DATE/
cp job_opportunities.db backups/$DATE/

# Compress older backups
find backups/ -type d -mtime +30 -exec tar -czf {}.tar.gz {} \;
find backups/ -type d -mtime +30 -exec rm -rf {} \;
```

### Version Control

**Git Integration:**
```bash
# Initialize git repository for job search tracking
git init job_search_tracking
cd job_search_tracking

# Add files (excluding sensitive data)
echo "job_opportunities.db" >> .gitignore
echo "*.personal" >> .gitignore

git add job_search_report.md application_strategy.md
git commit -m "Job search results for $(date +%Y-%m-%d)"
```

**Change Tracking:**
```bash
# Compare reports across searches
diff previous_search/job_search_report.md current_search/job_search_report.md

# Track database changes
sqlite3 job_opportunities.db "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM job_opportunities WHERE discovered_date > datetime('now', '-7 days')"
```

## Integration and Automation

### Automated Analysis

**Weekly Report Script:**
```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
"""
Generate weekly job search analytics report
"""
import sqlite3
import pandas as pd
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

def generate_weekly_report():
    conn = sqlite3.connect('job_opportunities.db')

    # Get last week's data
    week_ago = datetime.now() - timedelta(days=7)

    query = """
    SELECT title, company, match_score, discovered_date
    FROM job_opportunities
    WHERE discovered_date > ?
    ORDER BY match_score DESC
    """

    df = pd.read_sql_query(query, conn, params=[week_ago])

    # Generate insights
    report = f"""
    # Weekly Job Search Report - {datetime.now().strftime('%Y-%m-%d')}

    ## Summary
    - New opportunities found: {len(df)}
    - Average match score: {df['match_score'].mean():.1f}%
    - Top company: {df.iloc[0]['company'] if len(df) > 0 else 'None'}

    ## Top 5 Opportunities
    {df.head().to_markdown(index=False)}

    ## Recommendations
    - Focus on companies with 85+ match scores
    - Consider expanding search criteria if < 10 results
    - Update skills profile if average match < 75%
    """

    with open(f'weekly_report_{datetime.now().strftime("%Y%m%d")}.md', 'w') as f:
        f.write(report)

    conn.close()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    generate_weekly_report()
```

### Application Tracking Integration

**CRM Integration:**
```python
def sync_to_notion(job_data):
    """Sync job opportunities to Notion database"""
    import requests

    notion_api = "https://api.notion.com/v1/pages"
    headers = {
        "Authorization": f"Bearer {os.getenv('NOTION_TOKEN')}",
        "Content-Type": "application/json",
        "Notion-Version": "2021-08-16"
    }

    for job in job_data:
        payload = {
            "parent": {"database_id": os.getenv('NOTION_DB_ID')},
            "properties": {
                "Title": {"title": [{"text": {"content": job['title']}}]},
                "Company": {"rich_text": [{"text": {"content": job['company']}}]},
                "Match Score": {"number": job['match_score']},
                "Status": {"select": {"name": "Not Applied"}}
            }
        }

        response = requests.post(notion_api, json=payload, headers=headers)
        if response.status_code != 200:
            print(f"Failed to sync {job['title']}: {response.text}")
```

## Troubleshooting Output Issues

### Common Problems

**Missing or Incomplete Reports:**
```bash
# Check file generation
ls -la *.md *.db

# Verify file sizes
du -h job_search_report.md application_strategy.md job_opportunities.db

# Check for errors in log files
tail -f ~/.job_seeker/logs/report_generation.log
```

**Database Corruption:**
```sql
-- Check database integrity
PRAGMA integrity_check;

-- Rebuild if needed
VACUUM;
REINDEX;
```

**Encoding Issues:**
```python
# Fix character encoding in reports
def fix_encoding(filename):
    with open(filename, 'r', encoding='utf-8', errors='replace') as f:
        content = f.read()

    with open(filename, 'w', encoding='utf-8') as f:
        f.write(content)
```

### Performance Optimization

**Large Database Management:**
```sql
-- Archive old data
CREATE TABLE job_opportunities_archive AS
SELECT * FROM job_opportunities
WHERE discovered_date < datetime('now', '-90 days');

DELETE FROM job_opportunities
WHERE discovered_date < datetime('now', '-90 days');

VACUUM;
```

**Report Generation Speed:**
```python
# Optimize report generation for large datasets
def generate_report_optimized(limit=1000):
    query = """
    SELECT * FROM job_opportunities
    WHERE match_score > 70
    ORDER BY match_score DESC, discovered_date DESC
    LIMIT ?
    """
    # Process in chunks to manage memory
    return process_in_chunks(query, limit)
```

## Next Steps

After understanding the output files:

1. **Develop Analysis Skills**: Learn SQL for advanced database queries
2. **Automate Workflows**: Create scripts for regular analysis
3. **Track Success Metrics**: Monitor application success rates
4. **Optimize Search Strategy**: Use insights to refine profile and search criteria
