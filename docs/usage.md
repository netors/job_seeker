# Usage Guide

Complete guide to using the AI-Powered Job Search System for finding and evaluating job opportunities.

## Overview

The system provides several commands for different types of job searches and system management. All commands are executed through the main Python script or installed command shortcuts.

## Basic Commands

### Standard Job Search

Execute a complete job search using your configured profile:

```bash
# Full command
python src/job_seeker/main.py run

# Shortcut (after pip install -e .)
job_seeker
# or
run_crew
```

**What it does:**
- Loads your profile from `knowledge/resume_template.json`
- Searches across multiple job platforms
- Evaluates each opportunity against your profile
- Stores results in SQLite database
- Generates comprehensive reports

**Example output:**

- Quick search: 10 results
- Comprehensive: 50-100 results
- Training data: 100+ results

### Salary Filtering

Filter opportunities by salary range:

```json
{
  "salary_min": 100000,
  "salary_max": 200000
}
```

### Experience Level Targeting

Target specific experience levels:

```json
{
  "experience_level": "senior"
}
```

**Available levels:**
- `entry` - Entry level positions

## Error Handling and Recovery

### Common Issues

#### API Timeout
```
‚ö†Ô∏è SerperDev API timeout - falling back to mock data
```
**Action:** System continues with mock data, retry later

#### Profile Not Found
```
‚ùå No user profile found
```
**Action:** Configure `knowledge/resume_template.json`

#### Invalid Search Parameters
```
‚ùå Invalid JSON format for custom parameters
```
**Action:** Validate JSON syntax and parameter names

### Automatic Recovery

The system includes fallback mechanisms:
- **API failures:** Switches to mock data
- **Network issues:** Retries with exponential backoff
- **Database errors:** Creates new database if corrupted
- **Agent failures:** Attempts recovery or skips problematic tasks

### Manual Recovery

If searches consistently fail:

```bash
# 1. Test system components
python src/job_seeker/main.py test

# 2. Check configuration
python src/job_seeker/main.py update_profile

# 3. Try minimal search
python src/job_seeker/main.py search_custom '{
  "job_sites": ["indeed.com"],
  "max_results": 5
}'
```

## Integration and Automation

### Scheduling Regular Searches

Using cron (Unix/Linux/macOS):
```bash
# Add to crontab for daily searches at 9 AM
0 9 * * * cd /path/to/job_seeker && python src/job_seeker/main.py run
```

Using Windows Task Scheduler:
1. Create basic task
2. Set trigger for daily execution
3. Set action to run Python script

### Data Export and Integration

The SQLite database can be queried for custom analysis:

```sql
-- Export opportunities to CSV
.mode csv
.output opportunities.csv
SELECT title, company, location, match_score, url
FROM job_opportunities
ORDER BY match_score DESC;
```

### API Integration (Future)

Planned features for future releases:
- REST API for external integrations
- Webhook notifications for new opportunities
- Integration with job tracking tools

## Best Practices

1. **Start Broad:** Use general searches to understand the market
2. **Refine Gradually:** Narrow down based on initial results
3. **Regular Updates:** Run searches weekly or bi-weekly
4. **Profile Evolution:** Update profile as skills and preferences change

### Result Analysis

1. **Review Match Scores:** Understand why jobs scored high/low
2. **Skills Gap Analysis:** Identify areas for improvement
3. **Market Trends:** Track salary and requirement changes
4. **Company Research:** Use generated insights for applications

### Application Workflow

1. **Prioritize High Scores:** Focus on 80+ match scores first
2. **Customize Applications:** Use generated strategies
3. **Track Progress:** Update database with application status
4. **Iterate Search:** Refine based on application success
